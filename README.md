# Libra

## Project Description:

This project is an asset management system that allows a company 
to keep track of their current stock. This involves a number 
of different type of transactions all surrounding the retail of 
merchandise and products. It is also able to calculate price based 
on profit margins, revenue,  costs, and taxes on the main window 
tab. Several interfaces were designed to deal with sales, purchases 
and clients. On the main window, other tabs were created to register 
movements within the inventory and transaction to clients. The client 
window serves as an interface to access client information. One 
can also classify items based on specifc properties with the ‘group’ 
functions. The program also supports a search bar to access items 
quickly. Additionally every table window supports sorting. Midway 
through the development of our project, we realized our goals were 
too ambitious given the time we had to develop it. 

## How to Run Libra:

In order to make the user experience more convenient, 
we decided to add an executable called Libra.exe which 
only needs to be run eithr through the terminal or clicked on.

## Dependencies:

Libraries used are SqLite3, PyQt4 and built-ins to measure runtime.
